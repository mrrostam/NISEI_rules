%Introduction paragraph
Multiphase flows are encountered in a wide range of industrial, environmental and biological situation where rigid particles, bubbles or drops of indefinite shapes and densities are carried by a continuous phase. The dynamics of one phase influences the other in a variety of ways, which leads to complex interactions between the disperse and carrier phase. Examples of such situations include sediment transport in rivers, cloud and rain formation in the atmosphere \cite{Doychev2014}, fluidized beds and reactors \cite{Wachs2009}, bubbly flows and red blood cells in vessels. The dispersed phase is usually comprised of solid/non-deformable objects in sedimentation flows or fluidized beds, therefore the situation is more properly termed a ``particulate flow''.
